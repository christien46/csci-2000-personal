To create the new csv file that I would be reading from I simply downloaded the file from the link posted in the assignment pdf. I then opened it up and took 
out the columns that were not neccessary only keeping columns A, E, F, and I. I then had to rearrange the columns into the proper locations.


When it came time to save the file I clicked save as csv in the drop down menu. I made sure that the file was named "Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map_abridged" 
as I would have to read from it later. I then saved the file to desktop and then copied it to my Assignment folder.

There was a lot of random signs and symbols that were not neccessary inside the file. I had to go through and delete some of these values as well as the ones marked unknown.
